# Visit Counts System Documentation

## Overview
This portfolio uses CountAPI (https://countapi.xyz/) to track how many times each project link has been visited globally across all users and devices.

## How It Works

### 1. Global Database
- **Service**: CountAPI (free, no registration required)
- **Namespace**: `rica-portfolio` (unique identifier for your portfolio)
- **Keys**: Each project has its own counter key

### 2. Project Counters
- **speechy-pop**: Tracks visits to Speechy Pop project
- **marketing-plan**: Tracks visits to 12 Week Marketing Plan project  
- **crypto-bot**: Tracks visits to AI Chatbot Telegram project

### 3. API Endpoints Used
- **Increment**: `https://api.countapi.xyz/hit/rica-portfolio/{project-name}`
- **Get Count**: `https://api.countapi.xyz/get/rica-portfolio/{project-name}`

## Benefits
✅ **Global Tracking**: Counts persist across all browsers and devices
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Counts update immediately when clicked
✅ **No Backend Required**: Works with GitHub Pages
✅ **Free Service**: No cost or registration needed
✅ **Fallback System**: Uses localStorage if API fails

## Data Structure
```json
{
  "namespace": "rica-portfolio",
  "key": "speechy-pop",
  "value": 42,
  "created": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Fallback System
If CountAPI is unavailable, the system falls back to localStorage to ensure the counter still works locally.

## Privacy
- No personal data is collected
- Only anonymous click counts are stored
- Counts are public and visible to all visitors
